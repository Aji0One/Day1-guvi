1. Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
    The basic difference between HTTP1.1 and HTTP2 is the time taken to upload the content.
    example: HTTP1.1 is a standardise one for last 15 years but it is similar to one-lane road,
    when we look into HTTP2 it is like express highway.

2. Objects and internal representation in Javascript.
    ->Objects are representation of real world entity in any language representing things by defining its 
      properties along with their values.
    ->In other words, Objects may also be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or 
    reference types, in the form of "Key:value" pairs.

    syntax:
        var objectname={
            key : value;
            .
            .
        };

    Example: 
        var profile={
            name: "Luffy";
            age : 22;
            dob : 08jan1999;
            year: 2021;
        }
